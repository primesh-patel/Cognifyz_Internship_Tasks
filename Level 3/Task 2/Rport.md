## **Introduction**
As part of my internship at Cognifyz, I was assigned the task of analyzing customer preferences based on restaurant cuisines. The objective was to examine the relationship between cuisine types and restaurant ratings, identify the most popular cuisines based on customer votes, and determine if specific cuisines tend to receive higher ratings. This report outlines the methodology used, key findings, and insights derived from the analysis.

## **Dataset Overview**
The dataset contains various details about restaurants, including their ratings, votes, and types of cuisine. The key features utilized in this analysis are:
- **Cuisines**: The type of cuisine served at the restaurant.
- **Aggregate Rating**: The overall rating given by customers.
- **Votes**: The number of votes received by the restaurant.

To ensure data quality, unnecessary columns were removed, and missing values were handled appropriately.

## **Steps Performed**

### **1. Data Preprocessing**
- Removed irrelevant columns such as restaurant name, address, and currency.
- Dropped missing values to ensure clean and accurate analysis.

### **2. Relationship Between Cuisine and Ratings**
- Grouped the data by cuisine type and calculated the average rating for each cuisine.
- Sorted cuisines based on their average ratings to determine the highest-rated ones.

### **3. Popular Cuisines Based on Votes**
- Aggregated the total number of votes per cuisine.
- Identified the most popular cuisines based on the highest number of votes.

### **4. Data Visualization**
- **Top 10 Cuisines by Average Rating:** A bar chart was plotted to showcase the cuisines with the highest average ratings.
- **Top 10 Most Popular Cuisines by Votes:** Another bar chart was plotted to display the cuisines that received the highest customer votes.

## **Key Findings and Insights**

### **1. Highest Rated Cuisine**
The cuisine with the highest average rating was **Italian, Deli**, with an aggregate rating of **4.90**. This indicates that customers highly appreciate this type of cuisine for its quality and taste.

### **2. Most Popular Cuisine by Votes**
The cuisine that received the highest number of votes was **North Indian, Mughlaiâ€‹**, with a total of **53747** votes. This suggests that this cuisine is widely preferred by customers, making it a key area of interest for restaurant businesses.

### **3. Correlation Between Cuisines and Ratings**
- Some cuisines tend to receive consistently high ratings, indicating strong customer satisfaction.
- However, high popularity (votes) does not always correspond to the highest rating, suggesting that some cuisines may be widely available but not necessarily the best-rated.

---

## **Conclusion**
Through this analysis, I was able to determine the relationship between cuisines and customer preferences. Key insights include:
- **Certain cuisines consistently receive higher ratings, reflecting strong customer satisfaction.**
- **Most popular cuisines (in terms of votes) indicate customer demand but may not always have the best ratings.**

These findings can help restaurant businesses optimize their offerings by focusing on high-rated cuisines while also catering to popular demand. Further analysis could explore factors influencing customer ratings, such as pricing, service quality, and restaurant location.

## **Future Recommendations**
- **Conduct sentiment analysis on customer reviews** to understand why certain cuisines receive higher or lower ratings.
- **Analyze price and rating correlations** to determine if expensive cuisines receive better reviews.
- **Study regional variations** in cuisine preferences to help restaurant chains expand effectively.
