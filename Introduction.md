# Internship Report - Cognifyz Technologies

## Introduction
This repository contains the work completed during my internship at **Cognifyz Technologies**. As part of the internship, I selected and completed tasks from **Level 1** and **Level 3**, focusing on data exploration, preprocessing, analysis, predictive modeling, and data visualization.

## Tasks Completed

### **Level 1**

#### **Task 1: Data Exploration and Preprocessing**
- Explored the dataset to determine the number of rows and columns.
- Checked for missing values in each column and handled them accordingly.
- Performed data type conversion where necessary.
- Analyzed the distribution of the target variable (**Aggregate Rating**) and identified any class imbalances.

#### **Task 2: Descriptive Analysis**
- Calculated basic statistical measures (mean, median, standard deviation, etc.) for numerical columns.
- Explored the distribution of categorical variables such as **Country Code**, **City**, and **Cuisines**.
- Identified the top cuisines and cities with the highest number of restaurants.

#### **Task 3: Geospatial Analysis**
- Visualized restaurant locations on a map using latitude and longitude data.
- Analyzed the distribution of restaurants across different cities and countries.
- Determined correlations between restaurant locations and their ratings.

### **Level 3**

#### **Task 1: Predictive Modeling**
- Built a regression model to predict the aggregate rating of a restaurant based on available features.
- Split the dataset into training and testing sets and evaluated model performance using appropriate metrics.
- Experimented with different algorithms, including **Linear Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forest**, and compared their performance.

#### **Task 2: Customer Preference Analysis**
- Analyzed the relationship between cuisine type and restaurant ratings.
- Identified the most popular cuisines based on the number of votes.
- Determined if certain cuisines tend to receive higher ratings.

#### **Task 3: Data Visualization**
- Created visualizations to represent the distribution of ratings using histograms, bar plots, and other charts.
- Compared the average ratings of different cuisines and cities using appropriate visualizations.
- Visualized the relationship between various features and the target variable to gain insights.

## Conclusion
During this internship, I successfully applied **data preprocessing, statistical analysis, geospatial analysis, predictive modeling, and data visualization** techniques to gain insights from the dataset. The experience enhanced my skills in **data science and machine learning** while providing valuable real-world exposure.
